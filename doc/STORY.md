# Main Storyline of Branded

### The Curse of the Branded

Long ago, the world was ruled by ancient beings known as the Eidolons, entities of immense power that shaped reality itself. Some revered them as gods, others as demons. To maintain control over humanity, the Eidolons marked select individuals with a burning sigil upon their flesh—the Brand.

The Branded were both blessed and cursed:

- Blessed with supernatural resilience, unnatural longevity, and the ability to wield forgotten magics.

- Cursed to slowly lose their identity, as the Brand eroded their will, turning them into hollow vessels for the Eidolons' return.

When the Eidolons were overthrown in an ancient rebellion, their physical forms were destroyed, but their spirits lingered. The Branded became living keys, their existence binding the Eidolons to a prison beyond the Veil.

### The World Now

A thousand years have passed, and the truth of the Branded has faded into myth. They are feared, hunted, or exploited. Some kingdoms execute them as heretics, while secretive cults seek to use them to resurrect the Eidolons.

But something is changing. The Brands are awakening. Those who bear them are hearing whispers, seeing visions, feeling an unseen force pulling them toward an unknown fate.

### The Protagonist
You play as a Branded Wanderer, a warrior (or mage, rogue, etc., depending on playstyle) who has spent their life hiding their mark. One day, your Brand burns like fire, and a cryptic vision pulls you toward a ruined temple at the world's edge.

There, you discover an ancient prophecy: The Brands were never meant to be eternal. If all the Branded perish, the Eidolons will be freed from their prison.

Some seek to destroy the Branded to end the world.
Some seek to control the Branded to rule over it.
And some—like you—seek the truth.

### Your Goal
Your journey is one of survival, revelation, and choice:

Uncover the origins of the Brands – What was their true purpose? Were they merely shackles for the Eidolons, or do they serve a greater purpose?

Decide the fate of the Branded – Will you seek a way to remove the Brand, ending the cycle? Or embrace its power and carve your own destiny?

Battle factions that seek control – Fanatics, inquisitors, and cultists are all in pursuit of the Branded. Some want to eliminate them, others to use them. You must navigate their schemes.

Face the Eidolons – They whisper in your dreams, testing your will. Are they truly sealed away, or do they still hold power over you?

### The Core Conflict
Every Branded has a different reaction to their fate:

Some turn to madness, believing they are gods.

Some seek redemption, hoping to remove the curse.

Some embrace their power, caring nothing for the world.

But time is running out. The Brands are burning brighter, and the world is on the brink of chaos.

Will you be the one to break the curse—or become its harbinger?
